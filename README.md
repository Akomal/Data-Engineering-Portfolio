# Data Engineering Portfolio
Greetings! My name is Komal, and I'm excited to share my still developing data engineer portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find all of my personal projects which I have built as I learn new skills.

<h2>Eurovision Data Pipeline using GCP</h2>

This is an implementation of an end-to-end batch data pipeline that runs daily. It ingests the historical data of the Eurovision song competition, 
loads that data to Google BigQuery and finally produces insights via a dashboard.

The pipeline was built using **Python, Pyspark, Airflow, BigQuery API, Google Dataproc, and Google Data Composer.**



<h2>MLflow Model Repository: Streamlining MLOps with Experiments</h2>
Mlflow is a leading MLOps tool. This repository contains mlflow based models.
