# Data Engineering Portfolio
Greetings! My name is Komal, and I'm excited to share my still developing data engineer portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find my personal projects which I have built as I learn new skills.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/Eurovision-Data-Pipeline-using-GCP">Eurovision Data Pipeline using GCP</a></h2>

Used GCP, Airflow and python to build a data pipeline that cleans and transforms the data and make it avaible in BigQuery for visualizations.



<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/Mlflow-Experiments">MLflow Model Repository: Streamlining MLOps with Experiments</a></h2>
Mlflow platform is used to track the ML experiments and select the best performing metrices.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/From-Superstore-Dataset-to-Snowflake-Data-Warehouse">From Superstore Dataset to Snowflake Data Warehouse</a></h2>
Build a data warehouse using dimensional modeling and a no code EL tool Airbyte.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/YouTube-API-to-Postgres-Pipeline">YouTube API to Postgres Pipeline</a></h2>
Used Youtube API to extract data and performed data analysis using python.
