# Data Engineering Portfolio
Greetings! My name is Komal, and I'm excited to share my still developing data engineer portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find all of my personal projects which I have built as I learn new skills.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/Eurovision-Data-Pipeline-using-GCP">Eurovision Data Pipeline using GCP</a></h2>

This is an implementation of an end-to-end batch data pipeline that runs daily. It ingests the historical data of the Eurovision song competition, 
loads that data to Google BigQuery and finally produces insights via a dashboard.

The pipeline was built using **Python, Pyspark, Airflow, BigQuery API, Google Dataproc, and Google Data Composer.**



<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/Mlflow-Experiments">MLflow Model Repository: Streamlining MLOps with Experiments</a></h2>
Mlflow is a leading MLOps tool. This repository contains mlflow based models. 

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/From-Superstore-Dataset-to-Snowflake-Data-Warehouse">From Superstore Dataset to Snowflake Data Warehouse</a></h2>
In this project, we will build a Data Pipeline that will:
1. Take superstore dataset from data world and split it to different datafiles and apply data cleaing.
2. Build a data model and load the data to postgresql database using python.
3. Transfer the data from postgres to google cloud storage using python.
4. Build a dimensional model and load the data to snowflake data warehouse using airbyte.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akomal/YouTube-API-to-Postgres-Pipeline">YouTube API to Postgres Pipeline</a></h2>
Khan academy is a most used online education platform. In this project, I am trying to find out answers to few questions. This analysis can help people who are trying to build education related content on youtube. 

**Tech Stack:** Python, Data scraping, Postgres, Data Analysis and transformations.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Postgres, SQL, Airbyte, Dimensional Modeling.
